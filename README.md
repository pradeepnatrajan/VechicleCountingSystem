# VechicleCountingSystem
To effectively control the traffic management, parking management and for correct information  about traffic flow  we need automated  vehicle classification and detection systems  in  highly populated countries like India. Despite having many existing automatic systems for traffic control and Management there is a need of a highly efficient Model. So to help in this scenario, this project  introduced a efficient real time automated vehicle detection, classification and counting system. So that  we can enforce our people to follow the traffic rules and parking rules in public places. We will use a pre-trained model YoloV3 with some modifications to build the effective model. We have observed that our technique achieves significant accuracy  when implemented with  YoloV3. Our model performance is perfect for surveillance of traffic management system. As the result, this proposed system capable to count the vehicles crossing the road based on video captured by camera with the highest accuracy of 94.7%.
